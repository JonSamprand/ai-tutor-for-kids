# 🎓 AI Tutor for Kids

> Transform any educational webpage into an interactive, voice-powered AI tutor!

Perfect for homeschooling families, FLVS students, and anyone who wants personalized learning support for their children.

---

## ✨ What Does It Do?

AI Tutor for Kids turns your child's educational websites into interactive learning experiences:

1. **Navigate** to any educational website (FLVS, Khan Academy, Wikipedia, etc.)
2. **Click** the graduation cap button that appears
3. **Talk** to the AI tutor using your voice
4. **Learn** through guided questions and explanations

The AI can "see" what's on the screen (diagrams, text, images) and uses the Socratic method to help children think through problems instead of just giving answers.
